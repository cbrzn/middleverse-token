# Middleverse ERC20 tokens 

Middleverse is a play and earn gaming site that would include the latest blockchain tokens including ERC20 and ERC721 tokens. The steps to achieve this gaming marvel is to begin with the ERC20 tokens that would eventually be an essential part to run the whole ecosystem of the game. Staking rewards, vesting and every other aspect of the game relies on the ERC20 fungible tokens.

In this project we have the following divisions: 

1. The ERC20 MVG Token
2. Linear vesting of ERC20 tokens 

The ERC20 MVG Token: 
We have made a standard ERC20 token to deploy the MVG Tokens in a volume of 500 million. These tokens once generated have the functions that allow them to be minted and burnt as well. The owner of the tokens has these functionalities under his/her disposal


Linear vesting of ERC20 tokens : 
The ERC20 tokens are then linearly vested across multiple partners of the organisations. Mainly three of them include Advisors and partnerships that share similar vesting traits. Second would be ecosystems and marketing that again share characteristics of it being vested over a certain period.


Try running some of the following tasks for the MVGToken project:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
